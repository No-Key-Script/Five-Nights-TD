# Roblox Five Nights TD Script

Welcome to the **Roblox Five Nights TD Script** repository! This repository contains a robust script for creating and enhancing your very own Five Nights at Freddy's-style tower defense game on Roblox. With this script, you can implement exciting gameplay mechanics, realistic AI behaviors, and engaging tower defense strategies, all within the Roblox platform.

## üöÄ Features

- **Five Nights Theme**: Enjoy a tower defense game inspired by the popular *Five Nights at Freddy's* universe, complete with animatronic enemies and an eerie atmosphere.
- **Customizable Gameplay**: Modify game settings, enemy types, and tower abilities to suit your gameplay needs.
- **AI Pathfinding**: AI-driven animatronics move across the map, making the game dynamic and challenging for players.
- **Wave System**: Enjoy a wave-based system where players must defend against increasing waves of enemies.
- **Defensive Towers**: Create and upgrade various defensive towers to fight off animatronics. Towers can have unique abilities and attacks.
- **Player Progression**: Track player progress, including level-ups and upgrades for added game depth.
- **Responsive UI**: The script includes an intuitive user interface (UI) for easy management of towers, upgrades, and in-game actions.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Compatible with Roblox's multiplayer mode, enabling cooperative or competitive gameplay experiences.

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roblox-five-nights-td-script.git
   ```

2. **Set up your game environment**:
   - Open Roblox Studio.
   - Create a new project or use an existing one.
   - Import the script by placing it in the *ServerScriptService* or *StarterPlayer* based on your preference.
   
3. **Configure the game**:
   - Customize the towers, enemies, and gameplay mechanics using the provided configuration files.
   - You can easily adjust the number of waves, enemy difficulty, and tower attributes.

4. **Publish the game**:
   Once you‚Äôve made your changes, save and publish your game on Roblox. Invite your friends to play and defend against the animatronic horde!

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- **Wave System**: The script implements a wave system where each wave has unique properties. Players must survive a set number of waves by defending against incoming animatronic enemies.
- **Animatronic AI**: The script uses advanced pathfinding to control the behavior of animatronics. They will find the quickest route to the player‚Äôs base and attack towers along the way.
- **Towers and Upgrades**: Players can place towers on the map to defend against the animatronics. Each tower can be upgraded to enhance its damage, range, and special abilities.
- **Resource Management**: Players earn resources for each defeated enemy and can spend these to build and upgrade towers. Strategic resource management is key to survival.

- **Wave Properties**: Change the number of enemies, enemy types, and difficulty of each wave.

## üí° Tips & Tricks

- **Use strategic tower placement**: Some towers perform better in certain areas due to their range and damage. Experiment with placements to find the most effective strategy.
- **Upgrade wisely**: Don‚Äôt just build more towers; upgrading your existing ones can often be more cost-effective.
